  <h3>Camp Whole Kids</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The Family Enhancement Program focuses on health and child developmental 
	needs of families with young children. Many of the families who participate 
	in this program have experienced domestic violence, abuse/neglect, or have 
	children who have developmental delays. All of the families who participate 
	in our prenatal Resource Mothers Program (RMP) transfer to the Family Enhancement 
	Program for continued services that are more expansive than the childbirth and 
	well-baby education offered in the RMP. </p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Community Events</h3>

Community Events
WKO annually hosts two family community events – the Fall Family Fun Day and the Spring Festival/Easter Egg Hunt. 
Check back to learn of details as these events are scheduled – all in the community are welcome. Interested families 
may also call the WKO Center to obtain details. </p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Moms Day Out</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The mothers who are seen in the WKO home visiting programs can often feel isolated and overwhelmed. 
	Through the Moms' Day Out program, WKO provides relief from the day-to-day pressures of parenting small children, 
	while also giving moms a chance to gather together to share their stories and support each other. Through the activities, 
	the moms have the opportunity to learn about various topics such as child development, self-empowerment, healthy cooking and budgeting.
	There is also lots of time for fun and laughter, art projects and make overs too!</p>

  </div>
  
  <h3>Riding Program</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The Riding Program is a valued component of the overall WKO mission. Riding lessons are incorporated in 
	Camp WKO as well as in WKO’s afterschool program. Private and group lessons are available to area children and adults.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Swimming Lessons</h3>
  <div>
    <p>From mid-May through mid-September the beautiful swimming pool at the Center is open for private and group 
	water safety and swimming lessons. The Camp Whole Kids campers participate in daily group lessons, taught by 
	qualified instructor(s). WKO also hosts the Senior Aquatics Program provided by Whole Health Outreach during 
	August and September. The pool is also available for lease by private parties.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Hosting Groups/Club Meetings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The WKO Center is a great place to hold group or club meetings (e.g., Scouts, Rotary, etc.) birthday parties,
	family reunions, weddings, and other celebrations. WKO also partners with the Missouri Conservation Department to 
	offer fishing days for area school children and other groups to enjoy our stocked pond.</p>

  </div>
  
  <h3>Volunteer Program</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The WKO Volunteer Program provides an opportunity for volunteers to participate in “mission” as opposed to an 
	assortment of fragmented odd jobs. Volunteers are recruited from schools, established youth and community groups, 
	and through the many relationships WKO has forged with families, businesses and agencies throughout the country.</p>
