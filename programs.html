Whole Kids Outreach Programs
	<h3><a href="#">Family Enhancement</a></h3>
		<div>The Family Enhancement Program focuses on health and child 
		developmental needs of families with young children. Many of the
		families who participate in this program have experienced domestic violence, 
		abuse/neglect, or have children who have developmental delays. All of the families who 
		participate in our prenatal Resource Mothers Program (RMP) transfer to the Family 
		Enhancement Program for continued services that are more expansive than the childbirth 
		and well-baby education offered in the RMP.Through the Family Enhancement Program, parents 
		learn skills to raise healthy children and families receive help to successfully navigate 
		their daily lives. The children obtain tools to help ready them for school. They learn such 
		skills as using words (rather than acting out) to communicate their needs, and how to cooperate 
		and play safely. Outreach Specialists also work with families during crises episodes to help 
		teach problem-solving skills, which reduce the negative impact on the family that such disruptions 
		can cause.As part of the comprehensive approach to creating whole kids, the Outreach Specialists also 
		address many of the social factors that improve families’ heath. During the home visits, 
		we assist parents to continue or further their education; learn the skills necessary to 
		improve the skills needed to seek and sustain gainful employment; obtain adequate housing 
		and childcare; and budget their resources wisely. The Outreach Specialists create 
		individualized Family Service Plans with the parent(s) or guardians to direct and track the 
		family’s progress. Home visits, as part of the Family Enhancement Program, vary in number and 
		frequency and can continue for as long as the family needs our services and shows progress toward their goals.</div> 
		
	<h3><a href="#">Resource Mother Program</a></h3>
		<div>The Resource Mothers Program is a service to help prepare expectant parents for childbirth. 
		Experienced women from the community serve as WKO Outreach Specialists and visit expectant parents 
		in their homes. These committed women, who are trained as childbirth educators, 
		elp ensure that women receive adequate prenatal care and how to care for their newborn.<br>

	<h3><a href="#">Maternal-Child Nurse Program</a></h3>
		<div>In the Maternal-Child Visiting Nurse Program, WKO implements the Nurses For Newborns model, 
		which was developed in St. Louis, Missouri. WKO’s Registered Nurses visit expectant and new parents to 
		help ensure that pregnant women receive appropriate prenatal care and health education. By working with 
		the Outreach Specialists, physicians and other community service providers and resources, 
		the nurses provide a service in areas that are unique to the region. The WKO Registered Nurses are 
		experienced Labor and Delivery/Pediatric nurses. They not only teach well-baby care, but help identify 
		potential medical and developmental issues so that those needs can be addressed as early as possible, 
		giving infants the best start in life possible.</div>
